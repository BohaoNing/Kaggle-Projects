### This repository archives some of the Kaggle Projects that I've worked on:

1. [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)
  Create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck\
  Best model with tuned parameter: **Random Forest Classifier**\
  Best rank on the leaderboard: **top 5%** 
  
2. [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)\
  Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting\
  Best model with tuned parameter: **Blended Model with StackingCVRegressor**\
  Best rank on the leaderboard: **top 5%**

3. [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic)\
  Predict which passengers are transported to an alternate dimension\
  Best model with tuned parameter: **CatBoostClassifier**\
  Best rank on the leaderboard: **top 10%**

4. [Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting)\
  Use machine learning to predict grocery sales
